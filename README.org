  A [[http://docopt.org/][Docopt]] implementation in Emacs Lisp.

** Usage

   The Emacs command =M-x docopt= asks the user for the name of a
   [[http://docopt.org/][Docopt]] shell command, builds an Emacs [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] command from the
   usage help of the shell command, and finally, invokes the transient
   command.

** Example

   The Emacs transient command for the [[http://docopt.org/][Docopt]] example program
   [[https://github.com/r0man/docopt.el/blob/master/bin/naval-fate][naval-fate]] (must be in =PATH=) can be invoked with =M-x docopt
   [RET] "naval-fate" [RET]=.
