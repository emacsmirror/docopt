  A [[http://docopt.org/][Docopt]] implementation in Emacs Lisp.

** Usage

   The Emacs command =M-x docopt= builds an Emacs [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] command
   from the usage help of a [[http://docopt.org/][Docopt]] shell command, and invokes it.

   Given the [[https://github.com/r0man/docopt.el/blob/master/bin/naval-fate][naval-fate]] is in your =PATH= the following transient can
   be invoked: =M-x docopt [RET] "naval-fate" [RET]=
